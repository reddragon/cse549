We carried out a set of experiements with different values of N, M and L. The results for which are attached below. 

We used the naive greedy algorithm for calculating the shortest super string. N represents the length of the string, M the number of different fragments and L the length of each fragment. We find the ratio of the length of the original string to the length of the string we found using the algorithm. Along with this, we also find the time it takes to run that particular experiment and print this. 

The results are pasted below.

Some interesting things that we noticed after performing the experiments are as follows : 

With lower coverage, the ratio is almost always > 1. Which means that the actual superstring is not being found, but a smaller one is. This might be because there are gaps in the data set due to less coverage. 
As N reaches around 1024 and M reaches around 512, the time taken slowly increases to beyond a few minutes. So we carried out experiements only till N = 512.
The tipping point for the coverage seems to depend on the length of the string as well as the value of M. For higher values of N and M, a higher value of coverage is required to get an accurate result. Generally, a coverage of more than 32 seems to be sufficient to get an accurate result in most cases. 
The lesser the length of each fragment, the more accurate is the result for the same coverage. This seems to be because the value of M changes if the other two values are set. 

For actual DNA data from some place like Genbank, we found that we got exact matches for lower coverage and lower values of both M and L. However, at very low coverage, the accuracy was worse than what it was for random english alphabets. We think this is because DNA is made of only 4 characters and as such there is a higher chance of overlap here compared to in normal random text. The time taken was also higher than that in case of the english alphabet based strings.

The results for this are attached below.
