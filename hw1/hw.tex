(a) There are about 73 results for the Myoglobin gene. There are different sequences for different species, for eg. Homo Sapiens (Humans), Equus ferus caballus (Horse), Perkinsus marinus (A prevalent pathogen of oysters), Rattus norvegicus (Rat), etc.

\section{Problem 4}
Construct the suffix tree of, {$ A\#B $}. 
The suffix tree can be constructed in {$ O(n+m) $}, where {$ n $} is 
the length of {$ A $} and {$ m $} is the length of {$ B $}. 
Start traversing the tree from the first character of {$ B $} onwards, 
and initialize a counter. Now, keep incrementing the counter until you 
find a node with a valid \# pointer. This implies the end of the suffix 
of {$ A $}. If the node with \# 
\\
The traversal is done in {$ O(m) $}.

\section{Problem 6}
(a) Does not work. The example string itself “ABBABABA” is a 
counter-example. The greedy strategy would select the largest 
palindrome “BABAB”, and break the string into A-B-BABAB-A, 
which is four parts. The optimal solution is ABBA-BAB-A, or ABBA-B-ABA.\\
\\
(b) Does not work. “ABABABA” is a counter-example. The greedy strategy 
would select the largest palindromes from left. The largest and left-most
palindrome is `BABA' which starts at the 2nd position. This leaves, `A' and
`BA' at either ends, which leads to partitioning the string in this fashion
`A-BABA-B-A', i.e. three cuts. Whereas, the optimal partition would have
been `ABA-BABA', with only one cut.\\
\\
(c) An {$ O(n^3) $} Dynamic Programming solution exists.\\
Let $partition(i)$ be the number of optimal partitions required for the string starting at index $i$. Then, we can recursively compute the value of 

Then, the following pseudo-code can compute the value of $partition(i)$.
\begin{verbatim}
int solve(i) {
    if(partition[i] != INF) 
        return partition[i];
		
    for(int j=i; j<=n; j++)
        if(ispalindrome(i,j))
            partition[i] = min(partition[i], (j==n) + solve(j+1))
    
    return partition[i];
}
\end{verbatim}
We find the value of $partition(i)$, for all possible points of starting, $n$, and each time the loop executes $n$ times. If the $ispalindrome$ function can be calculated with complexity $O(n)$, the overall complexity of the solution becomes $O(n^3)$.\\
\\
TODO: A better solution with Suffix Trees, most surely exists, I think.
